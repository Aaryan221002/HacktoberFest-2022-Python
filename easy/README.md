## How to Contribute
Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Rules
- There are 40 programs in the repository. Each program contain utility.py, solution.py, test.py and README.md file.
- You have to write the solution in solution.py file.
- Test your solution by running test.py file.
- Desciption of the program is given in README.md file.
- If all the test cases are passed, after running test.py file, and there is no pull request for that program, then you can create a pull request for that program.
- If there is already a pull request for that program, then you can create a pull request for another program.
- You can create a pull request for any program, if there is no pull request for that program.
- You can create a pull request for a program, if there is a pull request for that program, but that pull request is not merged. Better pull request will be merged.
- Please check if there is already a pull request for that program, before creating a pull request for that program or solving that program.
- Please read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
