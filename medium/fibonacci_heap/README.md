## Fibonacci Heap

### Problem Statement

Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees. It has a better amortized running time than many other priority queue data structures including the binary heap and binomial heap.

### Input Format

The `fibonacci_heap` function takes the following arguments:

- `heap`: The heap to be inserted into.
- `key`: The key to be inserted into the heap.

### Output Format

The `fibonacci_heap` function returns the heap after inserting the key.

### Sample Input

```
heap = [100, 19, 36, 17, 3, 25, 1, 2, 7]
key = 5
```

### Sample Output

```
[1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 25, 100, 17, 19, 36]
```
