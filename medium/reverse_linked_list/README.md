### Reverse-Linked List in Python

#### Problem Statement
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

Given a linked list of **N** nodes. The task is to reverse this list. The given list may or may not be sorted and the nodes are of type either ```int``` or ```char```.

#### Input Format
Make a function that accept integer **N** as argument representing the number of nodes in the linked list. 

The next line will take an array **A** containing **N** nodes, denoting the elements of the linked list.

Also, make another function to accept Head **H** of the list as an argument.

#### Output Format
Print the reversed linked list and should also return new head after reversing the list.

#### Sample Input
```
7
[2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 33, 98]
2
```

#### Sample Output
```
[98, 33, 11, 9, 5, 3, 2]
98
```

#### Constraints 
- 1 <= N <= 10<sup>4</sup>
