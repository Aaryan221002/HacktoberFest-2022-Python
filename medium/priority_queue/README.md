### Priority Queue in Python

#### Problem Statement
A Priority Queue is an abstract data-type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a priority associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.

Given an array **A** of random integers and an integer **k**, find and return the **k<sup>th</sup>** largest element in the array.

#### Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of the size of the array. Let us denote it with the symbol **N**.

The following line contains an array of **N** integers, that denote the value of the elements of the array.

The following contains an integer, that denotes the value of k.

#### Output Format
Return the list of minimum distances between the source node and all the other nodes.

#### Sample Input
```
6
[9, 4, 8, 7, 11, 3]
2
```

#### Sample Output
```
9
```

#### Explanation
- We're given with array ```[9, 4, 8, 7, 11, 3]```.
- According to question, value of **k** is ```2``` i.e. we have to find the **2<sup>nd</sup>** largest integer in the given array.
- So, ```9``` is the answer.
