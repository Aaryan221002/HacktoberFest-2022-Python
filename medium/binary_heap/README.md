### Binary Heap in Python

#### Problem Statement
A binary heap is a heap data structure that takes the form of a binary tree. Binary heaps are a common way of implementing priority queues.

You will be given an array containing the scores of the **N** number of athletes. You are required to print an araay showing which athlete got gold, silver and bronze medal and the rank of the remaining players.

#### Input Format
You are given an integer array score of size **N**, where score **[i]** is the score of the **i<sup>th</sup>** athlete in a competition.
All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the **1<sup>st</sup>** place athlete has the highest score, the **2<sup>nd</sup>** place athlete has the **2<sup>nd</sup>** highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

_The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal"_.

_The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal"_.

_The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal"_.

_For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x")_.

#### Output Format
Return an array answer of size **N** where answer **[i]** is the rank of the **i<sup>th</sup>** athlete.

#### Sample Input
```
[5,4,3,2,1]
```

#### Sample Output
```
["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
```

#### Explanation
- The placements are ```[1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th]```.
