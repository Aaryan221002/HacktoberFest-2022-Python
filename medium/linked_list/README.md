### Linked List in Python

#### Problem Statement
a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

You're given the pointer to the head node of a sorted linked list, where the data in the nodes is in ascending order. Delete all the duplicate nodes from the list so that it does not contain any value more than once. The given head pointer may be null indicating that the list is empty.

#### Input Format
Make a function that accept integer **n** as argument representing the number of nodes in the linked list. 

The next line will take an array **A** containing **n** nodes, denoting the elements of the linked list.

Also, make another function to accept Head **H** of the list as an argument.

#### Output Format
Print the final linked list with every element not more than once.

#### Sample Input
```
7
[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
1
```

#### Sample Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### Explanation
- The initial linked list is: ``` 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 5 -> NULL ```
- The final linked list is: ``` 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL ```
