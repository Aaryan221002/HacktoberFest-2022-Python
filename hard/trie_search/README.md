### Trie Search in Python

#### Problem Statement
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Given a dictionary of words, determine if a given string can be segmented using the strings availablein the array.

#### Input Format
Make a function to accept integer **N** as argument denoting the total number of strings in the array **words[]**.

Following will take an array **words[]** of **N** strings.

Further, make a function to also accept string **S** as argument denoting that string to check for it's segmentation from the given array **words[]** of **N** strings.

#### Output Format
For each word, print ```True``` of the given string **S** can be segmented from the given array and ```False``` if not.

#### Sample Input
```
Total Strings = 8
words[] = { Goog, tClu, Student, leDeve, loper, Club, gdsc, cec }
String = GoogleDeveloperStudentClub
```

#### Sample Output
```
True
```

#### Explanation
- Combining the strings at index ```{0} + {3} + {4} + {2} + {5} = GoogleDeveloperStudentClub```.
